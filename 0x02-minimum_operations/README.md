# Min Operations
This function takes a single integer n as input and returns the minimum number of operations needed to obtain exactly n H characters in a file, given that the only two operations allowed are Copy All and Paste.

## Usage
To use this function, simply call it with an integer argument n:

python code
`min_ops = minOperations(9)`
`print(min_ops)  # Output: 6`
`If it is impossible to obtain exactly n H characters in the file, the function will return 0.`

# Approach
This function uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to obtain each possible number of H characters from 1 to n. It does this by initializing an array called dp with maximum values, and then calculating the minimum number of operations needed for each i from 2 to n.

For each i, the function considers all possible factors of i, and calculates the number of operations needed to obtain i H characters by copying and pasting the factor j, and then copying and pasting the remaining i//j factors. It stores the minimum number of operations found in the dp array.

Finally, the function returns the minimum number of operations needed to obtain n H characters from the dp array.

# Complexity
The time complexity of this function is O(n^2), because it considers all possible factors of each i from 2 to n. The space complexity is also O(n), because it uses an array of size n+1 to store the minimum number of operations needed for each possible number of H characters.
